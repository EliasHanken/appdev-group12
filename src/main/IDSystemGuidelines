For the sake of uniform implementation of object ids, the following system should be
used for ids for different systems.

Each item ID should consist of two segments of three digits, where the first segment signifies the
item type, and the second segment signifies the item nr.

An exception to this is orders. Orders should start with one three digit segment,
followed by one six-digit segment.

Bikes should start with ID nr 001. (I.e: 001004, 001261)
Helmets should start with ID nr 002. (I.e: 002073, 002541)
User should start with ID nr 003. (I.e: 003199, 003815)
Orders should start with ID nr 004. (I.e: 004560981, 004665123)
Textile bags all have the same Id. (005001)
